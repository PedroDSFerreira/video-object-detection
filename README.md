# Client-Server People Detection Application

This is a simple client-server application for people detection using YOLOv3. The server receives video frames from clients, processes them using YOLOv3 for people detection, and returns the number of detected people and their respective position back to the clients.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Installation

- Clone the repo and install the required Python packages.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/PedroDSFerreira/osm-mec.git
  cd osm-mec/app-demo
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

### Server (Without Docker)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory.

   ```bash
   cd app-demo/server
   ```

2. Download the YOLOv3 model files and place them in the `yolo` directory.

   ```bash
   wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights -P yolo
   ```

3. Run the server script.

   ```bash
   python server.py --h <host_ip> --p <port>
   ```

The server will start listening for incoming connections on the specified port.

### Server (With Docker)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory.

   ```bash
   cd app-demo/server
   ```

2. Build the Docker image.

   ```bash
   docker build -t people-detection-server .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container.

   ```bash
   docker run -p <host_port>:8080 people-detection-server
   ```

   Replace `<host_port>` with the desired host port.

### Client

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the client directory.

   ```bash
   cd app-demo/client
   ```

2. Run the client script.

   ```bash
   python client.py --h <host_ip> --p <host_port>
   ```

The client will establish a connection with the server and start sending video frames. The server will process each frame and return the number of detected people and positions to the client.

## Configuration

- The YOLO model configuration file (`yolov3.cfg`), weights file (`yolov3.weights`), and class names file (`coco.names`) should be placed in the `yolo` directory.
- In the 'server/face_detection.py' file, you can customize the people detection parameters:
  - confidence_thresh: Adjust the confidence threshold for people detection. People with confidence below this threshold will not be counted.
  - NMS_thresh: Set the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold to control the overlap of bounding boxes.

Feel free to experiment with these parameters to optimize people detection based on your specific use case.
